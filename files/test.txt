This small round stone is the "Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon". 
The Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of
Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people. 
The Circle is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out from
one another, depending on which branch the reader wishes to follow 
in the path of teachings... 
It is said that some zerths spend years poring over the combinations 
of the plates, looking for new significance in the teachings.
Dak'kon seems to use the text as a means of focusing his 
spell casting abilities, for he pores over the tablet occasionally, 
memorizing the words.
